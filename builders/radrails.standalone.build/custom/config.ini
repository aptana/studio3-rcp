# Eclipse runtime configuration file
# This file contains a number of key/value pairs that are merged into the 
# System properties on system startup.  The values control the way the 
# runtime is structured and runs.

# Note:  Only platform:/base/ and file: URLs are supported.  In general the 
# URLs given may include a version number (e.g., .../location_1.2.3).  
# If a version is not specified, the system binds
# to the location which matches exactly or to the versioned location with the
# latest version number.  If a version number is given then only exact matches
# are considered.

# The URL for the runtime entry point.  The default value is
# platform:/base/plugins/org.eclipse.osgi 
#osgi.framework = platform:/base/plugins/org.eclipse.osgi
osgi.framework=file\:plugins/org.eclipse.osgi_3.4.2.R34x_v20080826-1230.jar

# The classpath for the framework found at the osgi.framework location.  This 
# comma-separated list contains either URLs or simple element names.  Simple
# names are assumed to be relative to the framework's install directory.  
# Typically this value need not be set as it is initialized by the framework itself.
# Version match searching is not done for URLs listed here.
#osgi.frameworkClassPath =

# The comma-separated list of locations to search for the splash screen file (splash.bmp).
# For each list element a subdirectory structure based on the pattern nl/<locale> is searched.
# The system binds to the first matching file.  There is no default value.
osgi.splashPath=platform:/base/plugins/com.aptana.ide.rcp

# The comma-separated list of bundles which are automatically installed and optionally started
# once the system is up and running.  Each entry if of the form
#     <URL | simple bundle location>[@ [<startlevel>] [":start"]]
# If the startlevel is omitted then the framework will use the default start level for the bundle.
# If the "start" tag is added then the bundle will be marked as started after being installed.
# Simple bundle locations are interepreted as relative to the framework's parent directory.
# The startlevel indicates the OSGi start level at which the bundle should run.
# If this value is not set, the system computes an appropriate default.
